## Diabetes Prediction Based on Health Indicators
This project aimed to develop a predictive model to assess diabetes risk using A1C levels and other health indicators, 
leveraging a dataset of rural African Americans in Virginia. By employing linear regression in R, the project focused on 
identifying significant predictors while ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the model. Key steps included extensive 
data preprocessing, such as cleaning and imputing missing values using advanced data wrangling techniques in R. 
This was an academic project with 3 others working on the project. My section of the project included data preprocessing and cleaning, 
dealing with multicolinearity, and outlier and influential points.The model provides insights into the relationship between health indicators and diabetes risk.
